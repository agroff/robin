# Robin Coding Challenge

This contains a solution to Robin's hiring game. Currently there are no tests and lots of improvements 
I would make but I'm trying to keep it within the time box. I'd be happy  to discuss and/or implement 
test coverage and  some structural  improvements if desired.

## Usage

```
git clone git@github.com:agroff/robin.git
```

Install Dependencies:
```
npm install
```
