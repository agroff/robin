# TS Base

This is a simple project which provides boilerplate for for a typescript project.

It includes:
- My preferred Typescript configuration
- Basic linting rules with eslint
- Unit tests with Mocha and Chai
- Code coverage via NYC
- Some default NPM scripts
- A state of the art `Average` class which can average all the numbers in an array!
